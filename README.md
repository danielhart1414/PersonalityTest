# Personality Test
This Java program will accept an input file containing personality test answers for multiple individuals. The program generates a text file containing personality types for each of those individuals.

The user must input a text file that has the same format as the following example. The first line contains a name, and the next line a string of 70 characters. Each "a" and "b" character represents an answer to a Keirsey Temperament Sorter question. The "-" shown below (representing a neutral answer) can be replaced by any letter, number, or symbol. The input file can contain entries for any number of individuals.

(Note that GitHub does not show the correct format for the below lines in the README reader. The name should be on one line, followed by the answer letters on the next line, followed by the next name on the next line.)
