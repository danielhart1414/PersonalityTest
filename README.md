# Personality Test
This Java program will accept an input file containing personality test answers for multiple individuals. The program generates a text file containing personality types for each of those individuals.

The user must input a text file that has the same format as the following example. The first line contains a name, and the next line a string of 70 characters. Each "a" and "b" character represents an answer to a Keirsey Temperament Sorter question. The "-" shown below (representing a neutral answer) can be replaced by any letter, number, or symbol. The input file can contain entries for any number of individuals.
